## Density functional theory for walls in dissipative particle dynamics

### Summary

This code computes the density profile, surface excess, and wall
tension, for a fluid of pure dissipative particle dynamics (DPD)
beads against a wall, using a mean-field density functional theory (DFT).

The codes are

* `wall_dft_single.py` : solve a single state point;
* `wall_dft_awall_scan.py` : solve for an array of wall repulsion amplitudes;
* `wall_dft_rhob_scan.py` : solve for an array of bulk densities;
* `wall_dft_zero.py` : solve for zero surface excess or wall tension;
* `wall_dft_minim.py` : solve for minimum perturbation to bulk;
* `wallDFT.py` : underlying python module implementing functionality.

All codes can be run without command line parameters, using the
built-in defaults.  

### What's being solved here?

Consider a fluid of particles at a non-uniform density œÅ(**r**)
interacting with a soft, short-range potential *U*(*r*), in the
presence of an external potential *U*<sub>ext</sub>(**r**). A
mean-field density functional free energy for this system is
